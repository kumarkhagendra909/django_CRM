First i just installed mysql connector module 
1. mysql-connector
2. mysql
3. mysql-connector-python
Second create a virtual environment, in my case virtual env named as 'virt'
Third installing the django module 

Fourth create django project named as besporecord, for this terminal command is used i.e.
django-admin startproject besporecord
here besporecord is our project name 

after the above terminal command run this command " python manage.py startapp website " this commad will create a new app for our django project named website

now we need to do some changes in besporecord/settings.py 
1. settings of database platform and adding the user name, host, password to connect with the database for our project :
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.mysql',
        'NAME': 'besporecord', # name of the database i want to connect
        'USER': 'newuser', # mysql username 
        'PASSWORD': 'newuser@123', # user password
        'HOST': 'localhost', # localhost means not doing with any real time server
        'PORT': '3306', # port number
    
2. add the app website in Installedapps
